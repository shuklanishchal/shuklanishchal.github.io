        <p class='title'>Let's break it down.</p>
      </div><br/>
      <div class='col-lg-12'>
        <p class='container'>Gladwell, in his book, describes three laws:</p>
      </div><br/>
      <div class='container'>
        <div class='row text-center'>
          <div class='col-lg-4 law'>
            <p class='title-smaller'>Law of the Few</p>
          </div>
          <div class='col-lg-4 law'>
            <p class='title-smaller'>The Stickiness Factor</p>
          </div>
          <div class='col-lg-4 law'>
            <p class='title-smaller'>Power of Context</p>
          </div>
        </div>
      </div><br/>
      <div class='col-lg-12'>
        <p class='container'>When describing each law, he uses, you guessed it, <b>stories</b> as his lead-in to each of them. The best part is that he uses the same order of story genres for every law. Here’s how it goes:</p>
      </div><br/>
      <div class='container'>
          <p class='container'>He starts off with a description of a real event,</p>
          <p class='container'>Then goes into experiments/statistics to prove his law,</p>
          <p class='container'>And to top it all off, he doses his readers with an awe-inspiring hook to the next chapter.</p>
      </div><br/>
      <div class='col-lg-12'>
        <p class='container'>It's important to understand that the book is written in 2002. This is why a lot of the examples that Gladwell uses, like <i>Sesame Street</i>, feel "old". If the context was that the book was made this year, the example might've been <i>Fortnite</i> for all we know!</p><br/>

            <p>Malcolm Gladwell wrote <i>The Tipping Point: How Little Things Can Make a Big Difference</i> to give his readers a view of his idea on how epidemics spread. He outlines this idea in his book through three different “laws,” as he eloquently puts it. The main question that Gladwell tries to answer is, “How does an epidemic tip?”</p>
