        </div>
        <div class='col-lg-12 text-center'>
          <p class='title'>Let's break it down.</p>
        </div><br/>
        <div class='col-lg-12'>
          <p class='container'>Gladwell, in his book, describes three laws:</p>
        </div><br/>
        <div class='container'>
          <div class='row text-center'>
            <div class='col-lg-4 law'>
              <p class='title-smaller'>Law of the Few</p>
            </div>
            <div class='col-lg-4 law'>
              <p class='title-smaller'>The Stickiness Factor</p>
            </div>
            <div class='col-lg-4 law'>
              <p class='title-smaller'>Power of Context</p>
            </div>
          </div>
        </div><br/>
        <div class='col-lg-12'>
          <p class='container'>When describing each law, he uses, you guessed it, <b>stories</b> as his lead-in to each of them. The best part is that he uses the same order of story genres for every law. Here’s how it goes:</p>
        </div><br/>
        <div class='container'>
            <p class='container'>He starts off with a description of a real event,</p>
            <p class='container'>Then goes into experiments/statistics to prove his law,</p>
            <p class='container'>And to top it all off, he doses his readers with an awe-inspiring hook to the next chapter.</p>
        </div><br/>
        <div class='col-lg-12'>
          <p class='container'>It's important to understand that the book is written in 2002. This is why a lot of the examples that Gladwell uses, like <i>Sesame Street</i>, feel "old". If the context was that the book was made this year, the example might've been <i>Fortnite</i> for all we know!</p><br/>

          <h1>How easy is it to read, really?</h1>
        </div>
        <div class='col-lg-12 text-center'>
          <p class='title-smaller'>It's easier than you think.</p>
        </div><br/>
        <div class='col-lg-12'>
          <p class='container'>Take a quick look at this excerpt from the book:</p>
        </div><br/>
        <div class='container'>
          <p class='container'>“This was the legacy of <i>Sesame Street:</i> If you paid careful attention to the structure and format of your material, you could dramatically enhance stickiness. But is it possible to make a show even stickier than <i>Sesame Street</i> ?” (Gladwell 110).</p>
        </div><br/>
        <div class='col-lg-12'>
          <p class='container'>Here’s what’s fascinating. He’s making a children’s show his focal point of explaining the Stickiness Factor, but look at the words he uses, like</p>
          <div class='container'>
            <ul>
              <li>Attention</li>
              <li>Structure</li>
              <li>Format</li>
              <li>Material</li>
            </ul>
          </div>
          <p class='container'> Gladwell, through his methodical diction, is laying out his ideas in an organized, professional manner, which makes readers overlook the fact that a children’s show was just used as evidence. That's what he's really good at: using ubiquitous references and credibly explaining them with high level diction, and that's what, in fact, makes reading this book easy.</p>

        <h1>How does Gladwell Paint With his Words?</h1>
      </div>
      <div class='col-lg-12 text-center'>
        <p class='title-smaller'>His words are the paintbrush and his book is his canvas.</p>
      </div><br/>
      <div class='col-lg-12'>
        <p class='container'>As cheesy as that line is, that's the truth with Gladwell's writing. He creates art with his words that has elements that audiences of all age groups middle school and above relate to.</p><br/>
        <p class='container'>Gladwell's paintbrushes are the different rhetorical choices he uses. Take a look at the carousel below to see a few examples and their explanations.</p>

                <div class='col-md-12'>
                  <p class='container'>"When we say that a handful of East Village kids started the Hush Puppies epidemic, or that the scattering of the residents of a few housing projects was sufficient to start Baltimore's syphilis epidemic, what we are really saying is that in a given process or system some people matter more than others" (Gladwell 19).</p>
                  <p class='container'>All of what Gladwell says in this whole book leads to the conclusion that how epidemics start is paradoxical. Gladwell's main idea throughout this whole book is that epidemics start with very few people in the beginning, which is a paradoxical statement in itself. To explain this paradoxical idea, Gladwell used, as you must've guessed, multiple paradoxes in his examples. The paintbrush of paradox is Gladwell's favorite in his whole book, and that's the one he uses to fill up his canvas mostly.</p>

                    <p class='container'>Gladwell's use of simile in this quote relates to the sports fans, especially baseball, for which there were quite a few fans of all ages back in 2002, when this book was made. Gladwell's exceptional knowledge of his audience and how to use rhetorical choices to appeal to them is what this exemplifies, and his use of the simile paintbrush helps connect his art to a more general audience.</p>

                    <p class='container'>Gladwell's metaphors in this book are always related to something he's elaborated on earlier. Without giving away any spoilers, the gold box was mentioned earlier in the chapter, in relation to the Stickiness Factor. Gladwell likes to use the metaphor paintbrush to relate and connect that section of his art to what's present on the rest of the canvas.</p>

            <p>Malcolm Gladwell wrote <i>The Tipping Point: How Little Things Can Make a Big Difference</i> to give his readers a view of his idea on how epidemics spread. He outlines this idea in his book through three different “laws,” as he eloquently puts it. The main question that Gladwell tries to answer is, “How does an epidemic tip?”</p>
