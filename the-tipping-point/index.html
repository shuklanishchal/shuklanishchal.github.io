            <p>Malcolm Gladwell wrote <i>The Tipping Point: How Little Things Can Make a Big Difference</i> to give his readers a view of his idea on how epidemics spread. He outlines this idea in his book through three different “laws,” as he eloquently puts it. The main question that Gladwell tries to answer is, “How does an epidemic tip?”</p>
