        </div>
        <div class='col-lg-12 text-center'>
          <p class='title'>Let's break it down.</p>
        </div><br/>
        <div class='col-lg-12'>
          <p class='container'>Gladwell, in his book, describes three laws:</p>
        </div><br/>
        <div class='container'>
          <div class='row text-center'>
            <div class='col-lg-4 law'>
              <p class='title-smaller'>Law of the Few</p>
            </div>
            <div class='col-lg-4 law'>
              <p class='title-smaller'>The Stickiness Factor</p>
            </div>
            <div class='col-lg-4 law'>
              <p class='title-smaller'>Power of Context</p>
            </div>
          </div>
        </div><br/>
        <div class='col-lg-12'>
          <p class='container'>When describing each law, he uses, you guessed it, <b>stories</b> as his lead-in to each of them. The best part is that he uses the same order and pattern of story explanations for every law. Here’s how it goes, with an example of each part from Chapter 2 (for spoiler avoiding purposes):</p>
        </div><br/>
        <div class='container'>
            <p class='container'>He starts off with a <b>description of a real event</b> to introduce the topic.</p>
            <p class='container'>"On the afternoon of April 18, 1775, a young boy who worked at a livery stable in Boston overheard one British army officer say to another something about 'hell to pay tomorrow'" (Gladwell 30). <sup onclick='scrollToAnchor("cite1")'>1</sup></p><br/>
            <p class='container'>He then goes into <b>experiments/statistics</b> to prove his law, as well as to establish credibility and appeal to the logic of his audience to keep them engaged.</p>
            <p class='container'>"In the late 1960s, the psychologisy Stanley Milgram conducted an experiment to find an answer to what is known as the small-world problem" (Gladwell 34). <sup onclick='scrollToAnchor("cite1")'>1</sup></p><br/>
            <p class='container'>And to wrap the chapter up, he <b>reminds his readers</b> of what just happened in the chapter.</p>
            <p class='container'>"relying along the way on a small number of very special people: a few Salesmen and a man with the particular genius of both a Maven and a Connector" (Gladwell 88). <sup onclick='scrollToAnchor("cite1")'>1</sup></p><br/>
        </div><br/>
        <div class='col-lg-12'>
          <p class='container'>This follows the arrangement of the Classical Model to the T, if you haven't noticed already. Gladwell loves this arrangement, as he incorporates it in every chapter of his.</p>
          <p class='container'>It's important to understand that the book is written in 2000. This means that Gladwell uses examples from back then that his audience, middle/high schoolers and above, would understand, like <i>Sesame Street</i> or <i>Blue's Clues</i>. If the book was written in recent years, there would be quite a few more options, like how <i>Fortnite</i> or other such video games tipped.</p><br/>

          <h1>How easy is it to read, really?</h1>
        </div>
        <div class='col-lg-12 text-center'>
          <p class='title-smaller'>It's easier than you think.</p>
        </div><br/>
        <div class='col-lg-12'>
          <p class='container'>Take a quick look at this excerpt from the book:</p>
        </div><br/>
        <div class='container'>
          <p class='container'>“This was the legacy of <i>Sesame Street:</i> If you paid careful attention to the structure and format of your material, you could dramatically enhance stickiness. But is it possible to make a show even stickier than <i>Sesame Street</i> ?” (Gladwell 110). <sup onclick='scrollToAnchor("cite1")'>1</sup></p>
        </div><br/>
        <div class='col-lg-12'>
          <p class='container'>Here’s what’s fascinating. He’s making a children’s show his focal point of explaining the Stickiness Factor, but look at the words he uses, like</p>
          <div class='container'>
            <ul>
              <li>Attention</li>
              <li>Structure</li>
              <li>Format</li>
              <li>Material</li>
            </ul>
          </div>
          <p class='container'> Gladwell, through his methodical and logical diction, is laying out his ideas in an organized, professional manner, which makes readers overlook the fact that a children’s show was just used as evidence. This same logical diction is what directly contributes to the casual tone that Gladwell tries to keep, as he's trying to communicate to a very vast and general audience. That's what he's really good at: using ubiquitous references and credibly explaining them with high level diction, and that's what makes reading this book easy.</p><br/>

        <h1>How does Gladwell Paint With his Words?</h1>
      </div>
      <div class='col-lg-12 text-center'>
        <p class='title-smaller'>His devices are the paintbrush and his book is his canvas.</p>
      </div><br/>
      <div class='col-lg-12'>
        <p class='container'>As cheesy as that line is, that's the truth with Gladwell's writing. He creates art with his words that has elements that audiences of all age groups middle school and above relate to.</p><br/>
        <p class='container'>Gladwell's paintbrushes are the different rhetorical devices he uses. <span id='desktop'>Take a look at</span><span id='swipe' style='display: none;'><b>Swipe</b> through</span> the carousel below to see a few examples and their explanations!</p>

                  <p class='container'>"When we say that a handful of East Village kids started the Hush Puppies epidemic, or that the scattering of the residents of a few housing projects was sufficient to start Baltimore's syphilis epidemic, what we are really saying is that in a given process or system some people matter more than others" (Gladwell 19). <sup onclick='scrollToAnchor("cite1")'>1</sup></p>
                  <p class='container'>All of what Gladwell says in this whole book leads to the conclusion that how epidemics start is paradoxical. Gladwell's main idea throughout this whole book is that epidemics start with very few people in the beginning, which is a paradoxical statement in itself. To explain this paradoxical idea, Gladwell used, as you must've guessed, multiple paradoxes in his examples. The paintbrush of paradox is Gladwell's favorite in his whole book, and that's the one he uses to fill up his canvas mostly.</p>

                    <p class='container'>"If you watch <i>Blue's Clues</i> with a group of children, the success of this strategy is obvious. It's as if they're a group of diehard Yankees fans at a basketball game" (Gladwell 124). <sup onclick='scrollToAnchor("cite1")'>1</sup></p>
                    <p class='container'>Gladwell's use of simile in this quote appeals to the sports fans, especially baseball, because of the fact that there were quite a few fans of all ages back in 2000, when this book was made. Gladwell's exceptional knowledge of his audience and how to use rhetorical choices to appeal to them is what this exemplifies, and his use of the simile paintbrush helps connect his art to a more general audience.</p>

                    <p class='container'>Gladwell's metaphors in this book are always related to something he's elaborated on earlier. Without giving away any spoilers, the gold box was mentioned earlier in the chapter, in relation to the Stickiness Factor. Gladwell likes to use the metaphor paintbrush to relate and connect that section of his art to what's present on the rest of the canvas.</p>

            <p>Malcolm Gladwell was a former reporter for the <i>Washington Post</i>, in which, for a brief period of time, he covered the AIDS epidemic <sup onclick='scrollToAnchor("cite2")'>2</sup>. This is the influence on Gladwell which made him write <i>The Tipping Point: How Little Things Can Make a Big Difference</i>. His experience as a journalist is also how he has a very nice awareness for who his audience is, and he has a knack for bringing up examples accordingly. He wrote this book to elaborate his ideas on how epidemics spread, as can be inferred by his exigence to write this book. The main idea and the main question that Gladwell, throughout this book, tries to answer is, “How does an epidemic tip?”</p>
